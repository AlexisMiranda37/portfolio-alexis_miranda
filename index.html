        <p>This is my portfolio that includes examples
        of my work in Mr.Lanus' web design class. It also includes my
        reflections (below) on what I learned in each unit of the course.</p>

    <h2>Unit 1:HTML</h2>
    <!--ad reflection answer below-->
      <p><strong>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key
         concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?
       </strong></p>
        <p>
         The most important vocabulary terms or key concepts to me are the paragraph
         tags, ul and ol tags, body tags, htmltags, head tags, style, etc and most
         importantly the doctype tag.
       </p>
      <p><strong>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned
        in this unit of study?</strong></p>
        <p>
        The most important skill I have learned what tags areand how to use them
        properly. That was the most important skill I have learned so far since
        withought t his skill i wouldnt be able to do anything.
      </p>
      <p><strong>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work? In what
        ways do you think you need to improve?</strong></p>
        <p>
        The ways I have gotten better is by not having to look back all the time
         to codeacademy now I have been able to do much more on my own. I stil
         need to improve on being able to do all my tags opened and closed correctly
         since there are still times that I dont open and close them properly.
       </p>
      <p><strong>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this
         piece? How did you solve them? </strong></p>
         <p>
         The main problems that I had were some like not closing tags properly
         or not closing some tags at all. I have fixed them all now.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process
        or the finished product?</strong></p>
        <p>
        The thing I found most satisfying was being able to see how all this codeing
        changes into actual commands that the computer knows how to read and translates
        it to where we can also read it.
       </p>
      <p><strong>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about
        this piece?  </strong></P>
        <p>
        If I was a teacher I would comment either what needs to be slightly adjusted
        or maybe needs to be completely changed to something better to make the
        website better.
