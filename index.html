        <p>This is my portfolio that includes examples
        of my work in Mr.Lanus' web design class. It also includes my
        reflections (below) on what I learned in each unit of the course.</p>

    <h2>Unit 1:HTML</h2>
    <!--ad reflection answer below-->
      <p><strong>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key
         concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?
       </strong></p>
        <p>
         The most important vocabulary terms or key concepts to me are the paragraph
         tags, ul and ol tags, body tags, htmltags, head tags, style, etc and most
         importantly the doctype tag.
       </p>
      <p><strong>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned
        in this unit of study?</strong></p>
        <p>
        The most important skill I have learned what tags areand how to use them
        properly. That was the most important skill I have learned so far since
        withought t his skill i wouldnt be able to do anything.
      </p>
      <p><strong>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work? In what
        ways do you think you need to improve?</strong></p>
        <p>
        The ways I have gotten better is by not having to look back all the time
         to codeacademy now I have been able to do much more on my own. I stil
         need to improve on being able to do all my tags opened and closed correctly
         since there are still times that I dont open and close them properly.
       </p>
      <p><strong>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this
         piece? How did you solve them? </strong></p>
         <p>
         The main problems that I had were some like not closing tags properly
         or not closing some tags at all. I have fixed them all now.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process
        or the finished product?</strong></p>
        <p>
        The thing I found most satisfying was being able to see how all this codeing
        changes into actual commands that the computer knows how to read and translates
        it to where we can also read it.
       </p>
      <p><strong>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about
        this piece?  </strong></P>
        <p>
        If I was a teacher I would comment either what needs to be slightly adjusted
        or maybe needs to be completely changed to something better to make the
        website better.
      </p>
  <h2>Unit 1: Designing & Planning Web Pages</h2>
  <p>
  !coming soon!
  </p>

  <h2>Unit 2: Creating Pages with HTML</h2>


    <strong><p>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms
      (or key concepts)in this unit? What do you think that they mean?
    </p></strong>
    <p>
      We learned CSS style sheets, style, and the new comment tags in css style
      sheets which is important to know because without this type of vocabulary
      we wouldn't be able to add any styles to our page.
    </p>
    <strong><P>What do you think are the most important skills that you
      learned in this unit of study?</strong></P>
      <p>
        The most important skills I learned were knowing how to add color, images,
        borders, and most importantly add ha good color scheme.
      </p>
    <strong><p>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?
    </strong></p>
    <p>
      I can do it without having to refer back to codecademy every time like I
       used to  have to spend more time going back and forth checking how it is
       that  the tags should be written.
    </p>
    <strong><p>In what ways do you think you need to improve?</strong></p>
    <p>
      I need to improve on understanding what colors I am using and why. I also
      need to improve on looking  back less to codecademy like I am used to.

    </p>
    <strong><p>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this
    piece?How did you solve them?</strong></p>
    <p>
      The problems I encountered normally were simple mistakes I made by not
      spelling correctly  or adding commas and slashes where they are supposed to go.

    </p>
    <strong><p>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or
    the finished product?</strong></p>
    <p>
      What was especially satisfying was being able to see me advancing so much
      from  starting from a blank page and having a page with different styles and colors.

    </p>
    <strong><p>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about
    this piece?</strong></p>
    <p>
      I would say that there are changes I need to make and clean up my page by
      organizing my atom and making it easy for others to read.
